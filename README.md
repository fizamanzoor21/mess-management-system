🍽️ Mess Management System

A role-based web application designed to automate institutional mess operations with secure authentication, automated billing, attendance tracking, and online payment integration.

📌 Project Overview

The Mess Management System replaces traditional manual mess management processes with a structured, secure, and user-centered digital solution.
